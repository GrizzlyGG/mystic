    <h2>What is AI-generated art and Traditional Art</h2>
    
    <p>The introduction of AI has revolutionized many industries and the artistic world is no exception. But first we have to understand what AI-Generated art actually is, created through algorithms and code which allows the machine to learn by using large datasets of existing art to understand patterns and create new art through these inputs. AI-generated art has sparked excitement since its introduction, however on the other hand there is also a lot of controversy around the threat towards human artistic talent and creativity. This has also started to challenge how we define art and talent as a whole. Historically artistic talent and creativity has always been associated with human skill including the ability to portray personal expressions and feelings through visual media. But with the rise of AI in recent years the line between human creativity and skill compared to AI-Generated art has become less definitive.

    <h2>
        The illusion of creativity and talent in AI-generated art
    </h2>
    <p>
        I’d like to start off this section of my literature review with a quote. “How easy it is to create the illusion of talent, hence perhaps of judgment deserving of credibility… A certain danger lurks there.” - Joseph Weizenabum. I feel that this quote resonates closely with the topic of AI-generative art and how it is capable of creating the illusion of genuine artistic talent. Looking at AI-generated art it’s become a common theme to be described it as “uncanny and strange, but still strikingly realistic” (Corrall, 2024) I agree with this statement as when i’ve researched AI-generated art most images which were set with a prompt to portray realism were oddly close to how a photographer’s images or how a painting from a skilled artist would look. Although AI-generated art can seem very realistic there are of course still mistakes for example some images are seen showing hands with seven fingers or distorted features.

        <h2>Traditional artistic talent compared to AI-generated art </h2>
        <p>
            Traditional artistic talent is having the ability to create physical media with the use of pencils, paint, pens and other artistic tools. These forms of art have been around for centuries and have gone on to become some of the most famous and well known pieces of media in the world. Some of these pieces of art have even been sold for millions of dollars, for example Salvador Mundi by Leonardo Da Vinci which was sold for $450,000,000 (Jon, n.d.). Recently though, an AI-generated piece of art was sold for $432,500 in an auction at Christie’s. A researcher, Harsha Gangadharbatla saw the headlines for the sale of the piece of art and shook his head at it. After seeing this he began to question “I always assumed there was a soul that the human pours into the work. When a machine creates the work, how do people interpret it? Are they still moved? What role does the knowledge of who produced the artwork play in how it is perceived?” (Boucher et al., 2021). 

        </p>

        <p>
            This made me think about AI-generated art in a new light. For example, what makes human creativity unique in comparison to AI’s capacity to simulate creativity? To start i believe one of the most intriguing points is how humans create art in a way which expresses feelings and emotions which allows it to be portrayed through physical media, in turn when other people look at art pieces which are created this way they feel a connection to the images as they’re able to understand and resonate with the emotions expressed through the artwork. On the other hand when AI creates art it uses algorithms and datasets to create the illusion of creativity, while it can create the illusion of creativity it is impossible to truly express emotions or feelings through a piece of AI-generated art as the algorithm cannot feel emotions but it may still try to replicate these emotions and convey them through artwork which can make the pieces feel “hollow” or disconnected. Traditional artists also tie in personal narratives, life experiences and cultural backgrounds which resonate with the audience on an emotional level, Which is another thing that AI can’t compete with due to its algorithms and emotionless nature.

        <h2>
            AI-generated art and the concept of authenticity in art criticism</h2>
            <p>When discussing AI-generated art and the concept of authenticity one question comes to mind “If it wasn’t created by a human artist, is it still art?” (Mineo, 2023) From my perspective I believe AI-generated images can be classed as art but in no way is it to the same caliber of which a human can produce in traditional art. The concept of authenticity in art is very subjective, for example some people believe the authenticity of an art piece is based on the artist themselves and how good the piece actually is. Whereas others argue that it is much more than that, such as how emotions resonate with the audience or how moved people are by the art piece itself. Another key point is artistic intention, this determines the end product of the piece of art which is being created. While artists focus on allowing their art to do the story telling and explaining itself, AI is incapable of doing this due to its lack of personal connection or experiences which it cannot tie into any generated art pieces “It is also highly unlikely that you will see the artist present and ready to explain their exact intentions when creating their piece. Rather, it is just you, the museum staff, maybe a few visitors, and the art work—along with all of your preconceived ideas and expectations ready to influence how you experience what is placed in front of you.” (An Artist's Intention – Humanities Center, 2019). The point of “art” is that it can explain itself to the audience, however not everyone will see the same explanation or story in the art work which is what helps to keep artwork unique and interesting. For example many people will look at an image and see the pain an artist feels but others with different life experience may see the same piece of art and feel the complete opposite of these emotions. This is what I believe makes true art. It fascinates me that an image created by a human can be perceived in almost unlimited different ways depending on who the viewer is and what their cultural and emotional experiences have been through their life.</p>
<p>
    On the other hand AI cannot convey intentions through artwork as it simply doesn’t have any. AI-generated art lacks the contextual backgrounds and has never lived through any experiences that human artists can tie into their pieces of work. Which in turn means that AI-generated art often lacks the richness associated with traditional art as it’s almost like human artists pour their soul into the work they create whereas AI is simply following a command and learning through an algorithm.

    <h2>Creativity and skill: How AI-generated art has changed the perception of talent and creativity
    </h2>
    <p>
        Since the introduction of AI-generated art the perception of talent and creativity has been drastically altered. But while it has been said that AI-generated art is lowering the value of talent and creativity, others argue that it is simply there to aid and assist human artists in taking their creativity to new heights. 
    </p>
    <p>
        (Fortino, 2023) this article states how AI is aiding artists with a few key points “Inspiration and Idea Generation: AI can analyze vast amounts of data and generate unique concepts that might inspire an artist's next masterpiece. It can create unexpected connections between diverse concepts, fueling the artist's creative spark. Visual Exploration: For visual artists, AI-generated images can serve as starting points for new creations. AI algorithms can create abstract patterns, morph images, or generate unique compositions that artists can incorporate into their work.” I do agree that AI is aiding some artists in creating new links between diverse subjects which is something some may struggle to do on their own. However traditional art is still more unique as before AI was introduced artists would have to have the creativity and spark to be able to create their own connection to their work and discover ways to make the audience interpret this through their own eyes. Idea generation is an amazing tool which AI can help with, due to some people either not being able to concentrate and come up with ideas on their own or simply not being able to make intricate links between emotional and cultural life experiences. But I do also believe that this stops us from learning and finding new solutions to solve the problem of not having enough creativity which in turn can lead to repetitive or quite simple ideas created by AI. The other point of visual exploration is very useful and I believe that if used correctly AI can outperform a human in that manner. This is due to AI being an algorithm and not having any bias which allows it to create images which are morphed and created from millions of datasets which can be taken as inspiration by an artist.

        <h2>Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion the emergence of AI-generated art has undoubtedly influenced the perceptions of traditional artistic talent and skill in many different ways. Igniting both concern and excitement for the future of AI-generated art and traditional art. On one hand AI-generated art challenges the classical views of creativity and skill by producing impressive work which mimic traditional artist’s styles and craftsmanship. However, as I have mentioned in this essay, AI-generated art still lacks the ability to create artwork which ties in emotions, personal and cultural experiences to allow the art piece to explain itself to the audience as well as convey the artist’s intentions, which is where traditional art still shines. Some may still think that AI- generated art is a cause for concern as it threatens the authenticity or creativity or art, whereas others believe it can be a tool to human artist’s allowing them to use it to inspire them to create more unique art pieces. As well as utilizing AI-generated art’s unbiased opinions to create diverse links between subjects which would have no correlation allowing us to create some very intriguing pieces of work.
